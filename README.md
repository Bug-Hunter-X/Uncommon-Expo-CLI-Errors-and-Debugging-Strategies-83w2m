# Uncommon Expo CLI Errors and Debugging Strategies

This repository demonstrates troubleshooting techniques for uncommon errors encountered when using the Expo CLI. These errors often lack clear error messages, making diagnosis challenging.  The examples show how to identify and resolve such issues.

## Bug Scenarios

The `expoBug.js` file simulates a project with potential issues that can lead to cryptic Expo CLI errors. These include:

* Complex dependency trees that might cause conflicts.
* Issues related to network connectivity while installing or updating packages.
* Configuration problems within the `expo.json` file that are not immediately obvious.

## Solutions

The `expoBugSolution.js` file contains strategies for identifying and addressing such errors.  This includes:

* Examining detailed logs to pinpoint specific error messages or warnings.
* Using package managers with detailed logging (e.g. setting `npm --verbose` or `yarn --verbose`).
* Checking network connectivity during crucial steps of the workflow.
* Scrutinizing the `expo.json` and package.json files for any inconsistencies or issues.
* Using Expo's CLI commands to investigate app details.
