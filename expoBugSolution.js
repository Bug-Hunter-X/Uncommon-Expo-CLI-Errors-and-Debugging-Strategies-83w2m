Debugging these uncommon Expo CLI errors requires a systematic approach. Here's a breakdown of strategies:

1. **Verbose Logging:** Use `expo start --verbose` or `npx expo start --verbose` to increase verbosity.
2. **Check Package Versions:** Examine your `package.json` file to ensure all package versions are compatible.
3. **Network Connectivity:** Verify proper internet access for seamless package installation and updates. Network issues are often a hidden cause for such problems.
4. **Clean and Rebuild:**  Try cleaning your project's cache using `expo prebuild --clean`. Then rebuild the project using the usual `expo start` command.
5. **Inspect `expo.json`:** Double-check configuration settings within your `expo.json` file. Errors in configuration can cause a wide array of problems.
6. **Dependency Tree Analysis:** If you suspect dependency conflicts, use tools to visualize your project's dependency tree and identify potential conflicts.
7. **Environment Check:** Ensure Node.js and npm/yarn are up to date. Inconsistent or outdated versions can lead to errors.
8. **Examine Expo's Docs:** Consult Expo's official documentation and community forums for solutions to common and uncommon errors.
