This error occurs when using the Expo CLI with a project that has a complex dependency tree or when there are issues with the underlying Node.js environment.  It can manifest in various ways, such as unexpected crashes, build failures, or silent errors where nothing seems to be happening.  Often, there are no clear error messages in the console to indicate the root cause. The error might be related to incorrect configurations within the expo project, conflicting packages or even network connectivity problems.
